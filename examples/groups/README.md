# Groups Example

The [`groups_pipeline.rb`](./groups_pipeline.rb) shows how concourse groups can be utilized
within `rudder`. This pipeline also shows how to indiscriminately import
pipelines from other directories.

- The All group:
  ![Groups Pipeline](../images/groups/groups_all.png)
- The Bash Stuff group:
  ![Groups Pipeline](../images/groups/groups_bash_stuff.png)
